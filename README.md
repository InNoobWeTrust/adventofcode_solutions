# Advent of Code

This is my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Directory structure

Follow the challenges and folders in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## How to run solutions

There is a file named `exscript.part_*` for each challenge and each part of the challenge.

Open the challenge input file and then source the `exscript.part_*` file with

```
:so exscript.part_1
```

The result should be in the same buffer that you open the input file
